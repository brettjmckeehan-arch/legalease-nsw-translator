Applicant: Melissa Jane Foster (payee parent) Respondent: Thomas David Foster (paying parent) Current assessment: $450 per month for 2 children. Children have special needs requiring additional costs.,"LEGISLATION: SERVICES AUSTRALIA - CHILD SUPPORT

THE PROBLEM: Melissa Jane Foster, who receives child support, has applied to have the child support payments from Thomas David Foster reviewed because his income has increased significantly. Previously, he reported earning $95,000, but now he earns $180,000. Additionally, their two children, Sophie and Lucas, have special needs which involve extra costs for speech and occupational therapies amounting to $380 per week combined. Due to these changes, Melissa believes the current monthly support of $450 is not enough to cover these needs.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: If the reassessment finds that Thomas’s income has increased as stated, and the children’s extra needs are recognised, the amount of child support may be increased. This could impact the financial responsibilities of both parents, especially Thomas, as he might need to pay more each month to support his children’s additional needs.

YOUR OPTIONS: Melissa can provide proof of Thomas’s income and the children’s therapy costs to support her application for a reassessment.

THE PROBLEM: Residents of Maple Street are not happy with a plan to build a five-storey apartment building at 50 Maple Street, Lindfield. This area usually has houses that are only two storeys high. The new building would have 24 apartments on a small piece of land (800 square metres), which is more than usually allowed.

OBJECTION TO DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION

2. THE PROBLEM:
A group of people living on Maple Street in Lindfield don't want a tall apartment building with five floors to be built near their homes. They think it's too tall and there will be too many apartments in a small space. They are also worried that there won't be enough parking spaces for all the people who will live there, which might lead to cars taking up space on their street. Another concern is that the new building will block sunlight from reaching their homes, and that people living in the new apartments might see into their backyards. They are also worried that the building doesn't have proper plans to deal with rainwater flowing off the building.

3. HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU:
If the building is approved as it is, it could mean more cars taking up parking spots on your street, less sunlight in your home, and less privacy in your backyard. The neighbourhood could get busier, and your area might look a lot different.

4. YOUR OPTIONS:
You can ask the council not to allow the building to be constructed as planned or to make big changes to the design. You can also support the other residents who don't want the building by joining them in their objections.",0.8229693174362183,0.047058823529411764,9.277027397260277,True

THE PROBLEM:
The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) made two mistakes in the tax assessment for Innovate Solutions Pty Ltd. Firstly, they incorrectly did not allow Innovate Solutions to get a $180,000 tax discount for their software development work. The ATO incorrectly classified this work as routine development. Secondly, they incorrectly handled $250,000 Innovate Solutions spent on buying equipment. This equipment qualified for a quick tax discount called an instant asset write-off under the rules.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU:
Innovate Solutions Pty Ltd is missing out on a $180,000 tax discount for their software development work. They are also missing out on a tax discount for $250,000 they spent on equipment. This means Innovate Solutions has to pay more tax.

THE PROBLEM: Thomas Sullivan, the son of Margaret Rose Sullivan who passed away on November 10, 2025, has concerns about a new will dated September 15, 2025. He believes his mother, Margaret, was not able to make decisions because of a serious memory problem diagnosed in March 2024. He is also worried that her carer, who would get most of the estate in the new will, may have influenced her unfairly and kept her away from family. An earlier will from March 5, 2020, shared the estate equally among Margaret's three children.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: Because of Thomas's concerns, the court cannot approve or distribute Margaret’s will without informing him first. This affects how quickly the estate can be settled and who will receive what part of Margaret's estate.

YOUR OPTIONS: Thomas can ask the court to decide which of the two wills—either the earlier one from March 2020 or the later one from September 2025—is valid. He can use medical records and expert opinions to support his case.",0.830592930316925,0.08372093023255814,11.05531069364162,True

THE PROBLEM: Thomas Sullivan, who is the son of Margaret Rose Sullivan, has put a stop order, called a caveat, on the processing of his mother’s estate after she passed away on November 10, 2025. He believes the newest will, which was made on September 15, 2025, might not be valid. Thomas thinks this because his mother had serious memory issues from dementia since March 2024, the person who would benefit most from this will (the carer) kept his mother away from the family, and the will was made very quickly without her regular lawyer.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The stop order means that no decisions about who gets what from Margaret Rose Sullivan’s estate can be made without Thomas Sullivan being notified first. The later will suggested giving most of the estate (80%) to the carer, which is a big change from an earlier will made on March 5, 2020, that divided everything equally among Margaret's three children.

YOUR OPTIONS: Thomas Sullivan wants the court to decide which will is the right one to use. He has medical records and an expert’s opinion on his mother’s ability to make decisions at the time the last will was made. Thomas is working with lawyers from Estate Law Partners on this matter.

THE PROBLEM: Thomas Sullivan believes the will made on September 15, 2025, by his mother, may not be valid. He thinks his mother was not able to make clear decisions because she had bad dementia. Also, he thinks her carer made her change the will in a hurry and kept her away from her family.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: Because Thomas put a caveat, probate or sharing out of the estate cannot happen without telling him first. This means the will cannot be used to split the estate until this issue is sorted out.

2. THE PROBLEM:
Thomas Sullivan, the son of Margaret Rose Sullivan who passed away on November 10, 2025, has put a caveat to stop the legal process of giving out Margaret's belongings without telling him. He thinks there is a problem with the latest will that gives most things to the carer instead of sharing them between all three children like the older will did.

If the court agrees with Thomas, Margaret's belongings will be shared as per the older will. If not, the newer will stands, and the carer gets most of it.

THE PROBLEM: Eleanor Grace Thompson has advanced Alzheimer's. She cannot make decisions about her healthcare, where she lives or services she needs.
