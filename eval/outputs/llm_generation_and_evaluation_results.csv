THE PROBLEM: Residents of Maple Street in Lindfield are objecting to a development application (DA 2025/889) for a five-storey apartment building at 50 Maple Street.

The residents believe the development is an overdevelopment, with 24 apartments on an 800 square metre lot exceeding density controls.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The proposed development may cause various issues for the residents, including inadequate parking leading to street parking problems, overshadowing resulting in neighbouring properties losing more than four hours of sunlight, privacy impacts due to balconies overlooking neighbouring backyards and inadequate stormwater drainage for increased runoff.

THE PROBLEM: Residents of Maple Street in Lindfield, NSW, are unhappy with a plan to build a 5-storey apartment building at 50 Maple Street. They believe it breaks the rules about building height and space set by the LEP (Local Environmental Plan). The area is meant for 2-storey buildings, and the new building is too tall. The plan includes 24 apartments on a small piece of land, which is too many for the space.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: If the building is allowed, it could cause several problems. There could be not enough parking spots, leading to cars parked on the street. The tall building might block sunlight, taking away over 4 hours of sun from nearby homes. People on balconies could see into neighbours’ backyards, affecting their privacy. The drainage system might not handle all the extra water when it rains.

THE PROBLEM: Residents of Maple Street are opposed to a planned five-storey apartment building at 50 Maple Street, Lindfield, NSW. The building is taller than other homes in the area, which are mostly two storeys.

There is also worry about insufficient drainage for rainwater runoff.

THE PROBLEM: Residents of Maple Street are unhappy about a plan for a tall apartment building in Lindfield. They think the building is too tall and has too many apartments for the area.

THE PROBLEM: The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has disallowed Innovate Solutions Pty Ltd's research and development (R&D) tax offset of $180,000 for a software development project in the 2024-25 tax year. The ATO incorrectly classified the project as routine development. They also wrongly treated $250,000 of equipment purchases as not qualifying for the instant asset write-off.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: Innovate Solutions Pty Ltd will not receive the $180,000 R&D tax offset they believe they are entitled to. They will also not be able to instantly write-off the $250,000 spent on equipment purchases. This means the company will pay more tax than they believe is correct.

YOUR OPTIONS: 
1. Request the ATO review the assessment within 60 days, providing supporting documents such as the R&D project plan, scientist qualifications, technical reports and equipment invoices.
2. If the ATO does not amend the assessment, escalate the objection to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) for an independent review.",0.8548893928527832,0.2571428571428572,12.043580246913582,True

THE PROBLEM: Innovate Solutions Pty Ltd faced a problem when the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) did not allow a tax benefit called an R&D tax offset. Innovate Solutions Pty Ltd had spent $180,000 on a software development project that involved creating a new algorithm and solving big science questions. However, the ATO treated this project as ordinary routine work instead of research. Additionally, the ATO did not approve a $250,000 instant asset write-off for equipment that Innovate Solutions Pty Ltd bought, even though it should have been allowed.

Caveat prohibits grant of probate or administration without notice to caveator. Supreme Court of NSW Probate Division. Estate of: Rosa Martinez deceased 10 November 2025.,"PROBATE AND ADMINISTRATION ACT 1898 (NSW)

THE PROBLEM: Diego Martinez has lodged a caveat in the Supreme Court of NSW to prevent probate being granted for his mother Rosa Martinez's estate without him being notified. Rosa passed away on 10 November 2025. 

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The caveat stops Rosa's later will from September 2025 being validated, which left 80% of her estate to her carer. Diego doubts this will is legally valid because his mother had advanced dementia since March 2024 and may have been pressured by her carer, who had isolated Rosa from her family. The carer arranged the new will quickly without involving Rosa's normal lawyer. An earlier will from March 2020 split the estate equally between Rosa's three children.

YOUR OPTIONS:
- The Supreme Court needs to decide which of Rosa's two wills is legally valid, considering evidence of her mental capacity and if she was unduly influenced. 
- Diego can provide his mother's medical records and an expert assessment of her decision-making ability.

Caveat prohibits grant of probate or administration without notice to caveator. Supreme Court of NSW Probate Division. Estate of: Rosa Martinez deceased 10 November 2025.,"LEGISLATION: PROBATE AND ADMINISTRATION ACT 1898 (NSW)

THE PROBLEM: Diego Martinez filed a caveat on January 8 2026 to stop probate being granted for the estate of Rosa Martinez, who died on November 10 2025. Diego is Rosa's son and believes an earlier will from March 5 2020 should be used instead of a newer will from September 15 2025.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The caveat means the court cannot grant probate or allow anyone to manage Rosa's estate without first telling Diego. This stops the newer will from being used to divide up Rosa's belongings and money until the court decides which will is valid.

YOUR OPTIONS: Diego can ask the court to look at both wills and decide which one should be used.

THE PROBLEM: Diego Martinez, the son of Rosa Martinez, is worried about the validity of his mother's later will dated September 15, 2025. He believes his mother may not have been able to make decisions clearly due to advanced dementia. There are also concerns about the carer who stands to gain the most from this new will. The carer might have influenced Rosa Martinez, especially since the carer had isolated her from her family. 

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: Because of Diego's concerns, the court temporarily stops the legal process that would approve the later will. They need to notify him before moving forward. This means that without a resolution, Diego and his siblings might not receive their fair share of the estate if the later will is used.

THE PROBLEM: Diego Martinez placed a legal block called a caveat on his late mother Rosa Martinez's estate. This means no one can decide how to handle Rosa's estate without telling Diego first. Rosa passed away on 10 November 2025, and there are disputes about her will, a legal document that says who should get what from her belongings. Rosa made a new will on 15 September 2025, but Diego doubts it's valid because Rosa had severe memory problems from dementia diagnosed in March 2024, and her caretaker might have unfairly influenced her.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The block stops the court from confirming the will without informing Diego. Since Rosa's estate is large, and the new will favours the caretaker heavily, Diego is worried about the fair distribution of Rosa's belongings which were supposed to be divided equally among her three children, as stated in an earlier will.
