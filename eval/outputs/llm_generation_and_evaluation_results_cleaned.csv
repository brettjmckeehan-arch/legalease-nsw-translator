THE PROBLEM:
William Davies was hired to help with transferring property ownership in March 2025 and was paid $3,500. He did not attend the property settlement meeting on 15 June 2025, which caused the deal to collapse and resulted in the loss of a $50,000 deposit. Additionally, he failed to provide a statement for the trust account handling the funds.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU:
The failure to complete the property transfer has directly led to a financial loss of $50,000 for the deposit. The absence of communication and the missing trust account statement raise concerns about the handling of the funds.

THE PROBLEM: Melissa Jane Foster has applied to change the child support payment arrangement for her two children, who currently receive $450 per month from their father, Thomas David Foster.

THE PROBLEM: The problem is a plan to build a 5-storey apartment building on Maple Street in Lindfield, NSW. This area is only meant for buildings of up to 2 storeys. The building will have 24 apartments on a small lot, with not enough parking spaces. This could cause problems with street parking.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: If the building is approved as planned, the neighbours will have less sunlight for more than 4 hours, more street parking issues since only 18 spaces are available for 24 apartments, and less privacy in their backyards because of balconies.

THE PROBLEM: Residents of Maple Street are unhappy with a proposal for a new five-storey apartment building at 50 Maple Street, Lindfield, NSW. They believe the building is too tall for the area, which usually has smaller buildings of only two storeys. They also think there are too many apartments planned (24 on a small 800 sqm lot), not enough parking spaces (only 18 spaces for 24 apartments), that it will block sunlight to nearby homes, reduce privacy due to overlooking balconies and worsen drainage issues in the area.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The residents argue that this building plan goes against the local rules on building heights and how much space should be between buildings (known as Floor Space Ratio controls).

THE PROBLEM: Thomas Sullivan, the son of the late Margaret Rose Sullivan, has lodged a caveat against the grant of probate for his mother's estate. Margaret passed away on 10 November 2025. Thomas doubts the validity of Margaret's most recent will dated 15 September 2025.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The caveat prohibits the grant of probate or administration of Margaret's estate without notifying Thomas first. In the earlier will dated 5 March 2020, Margaret's estate was to be divided equally among her three children. However, the later will leaves 80% of the estate to Margaret's carer, who is also the proposed executor.

Thomas Sullivan believes an earlier will from March 5 2020 should be used instead of a newer will from September 15 2025.

THE PROBLEM: Thomas Sullivan has placed a legal block called a ""caveat"" against the estate of his late mother, Margaret Rose Sullivan, who passed away on 10 November 2025. This caveat means that no one can complete the process of distributing his mother's property (probate) without letting Thomas know. He did this because he believes something is wrong with the most recent will, dated 15 September 2025. Thomas suspects the will might not be valid because his mother was very ill with advanced dementia since March 2024, and the will seems unfairly influenced by her carer. Also, the last will was made very quickly and secretly, benefits the carer much more than the previous will, and wasn't made with her usual lawyer.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The caveat stops any actions regarding the estate until the court decides if the latest will is valid based on the reasons Thomas provided. This affects the handling and distribution of Margaret's property until a decision is made.

2. THE PROBLEM: Thomas Sullivan, the son of Margaret Rose Sullivan who passed away on November 10, 2025, has put a hold on granting probate because he believes there are issues with his mother's will. He thinks his mother wasn't thinking clearly when she made a new will on September 15, 2025, leaving most of her belongings to her carer, instead of dividing it equally between her three children as stated in her will from March 5, 2020.
3. HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: If the newer will is found valid, Thomas Sullivan and his siblings may receive less inheritance than they would have under the older will. This could mean receiving less money or property compared to what they were originally entitled to.

NO LEGISLATION MENTIONED

THE PROBLEM:
Thomas Sullivan believes the last will of his mother, Margaret Rose Sullivan, is not valid. Margaret Rose Sullivan died on 10 November 2025. Her last will was dated 15 September 2025. Thomas Sullivan is concerned because his mother had advanced dementia when she made the will. He also believes her carer put pressure on her. The carer kept her away from her family. The will was prepared quickly without the family's normal lawyer. An older will from 5 March 2020 shared her estate equally between her three children. The new will gives 80 percent of the estate to the carer.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU:
On 8 January 2026, Thomas Sullivan placed a legal stop, called a caveat, on the estate. This caveat stops the Supreme Court of NSW from approving the will. It also stops the court from allowing anyone to manage the estate.

Thomas Sullivan wants the court to decide which will is the correct one to use. He has medical records and expert reports to support his case. His lawyer is Estate Law Partners.",0.8356963992118835,0.1176470588235294,7.342913043478266,True

- The new will was made quickly without her usual lawyer

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU:
The old will from 5 March 2020 split the estate equally between Margaret's three children. But the new will gives 80% to Margaret's carer. If the new will is valid, Thomas will get much less.

THE PROBLEM:
Thomas Sullivan has stopped the Court from giving out his mother's will. He thinks the newest will may not be legal.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU:
The Court cannot give out Margaret Sullivan's will or let anyone deal with her things until this problem is fixed. This could take a long time and cost money.

YOUR OPTIONS:

- Talk to a lawyer about the old will from March 5 2020

THE PROBLEM: There is a disagreement about which will is valid for Margaret Rose Sullivan. Thomas Sullivan, her son, thinks a later will is not valid because his mother was not well and the carer might have influenced her unfairly.

HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU: The court cannot give approval for any will to be acted on until Thomas Sullivan is told. This means the estate cannot be divided or given out until the problem is solved.

THE PROBLEM: A hold has been put on deciding who will handle Margaret Rose Sullivan's estate because her son, Thomas Sullivan, needs to be told about it. He has some issues with the latest will.

SUPREME COURT OF NSW PROBATE DIVISION

2. THE PROBLEM:
Thomas Sullivan is concerned that a will, dated September 15, 2025, possibly giving 80% of the estate to the deceased's carer, might not be valid. He believes the will may not be right because the deceased might have been too sick (had dementia) to make good decisions, and the carer might have unfairly influenced the deceased by keeping the family away and rushing the will.

3. HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU:
The caveat stops the will being approved without Thomas Sullivan knowing about it. If the later will is accepted, Thomas might not get a fair share of the inheritance, unlike the equal split among the 3 children according to the earlier will.

4. YOUR OPTIONS:
Thomas wants the court to decide which will should be legally accepted. Medical records and an expert's review are ready for this decision. Thomas is getting help from Estate Law Partners, and they can be reached at estates@elp.com.au.",0.8300302028656006,0.1073170731707317,10.680609756097564,True
